    /// Class Overview:
    /// The UltrasoundManager (USM) is in charge of generating the Ultrasound (US) image. It uses the ultrasound probe's position
    /// in space, relative to specified anatomies to generate realistic ultrasound images. The ultrasound plane is rendered upon
    /// rebuild, and numerous variables can be used to manipulate the size and shape of the ultrasound's scanning plane. As it 
    /// sits, the values used to manipulate the scanning plane are only visible in the inspector, and the only functionality of 
    /// the USM is the generation of ultrasound images. The USM operates as a singleton. There can only be one instance of the
    /// class operating at any one time. All other instances are destroyed at Awake(). The references to the singleton instance
    /// of the USM can be made through the static UltrasoundManager ME. It can be referenced by any script using the namespace
    /// SMARTS_SDK.Ultrasound. The UltrasoundManager.cs class uses world units as the default measurement, and world units are
    /// generally assumed to be mm by CSSALT.
    /// 
    /// Future Functionality:
    ///		Dual-Axis US Image Reflection:
    ///		In later updates, the ultrasound probe will have the ability to be reflected vertically and horizontally across its
    ///		central axis.
    ///	
    /// Dependencies:
    /// This class runs as a standalone class and has no dependencies.
    /// 
    /// Developers:
    ///	2016 implementation used on original CVA and RA simulators: 
    ///	Dave Lizdas.
    ///	
    /// 2018 SMARTS-SDK: complete rebuild, ultrasound plane generation, and increased performance:
    ///	Andre Kazimierz Bigos
    ///
    /// 2025 SMMARTS SDK update, refactoring, and feature additions:
    /// Dave Lizdas, Simon Mesber

    /// TERMINOLOGY:
    /// "Scanning Plane" refers to a plane of points that represent starting end ending points for the raycasts.
    /// Scanning Plane has its own local coordinate system with the origin at the middle of the top edge. 
    /// The staring and ending points in Scanning Plane space are used for the raycasts after a world space transform.

                        - Maintains proper layering of materials
                        - Provides special handling for shadow (bone) visualization
                        - Manages the stack of currently active materials
                        - Ensures proper rendering order and material transitions
                    The loop essentially builds up the ultrasound image line by line, handling the complexity of multiple material layers and their interfaces.
                    It's particularly important for creating realistic ultrasound artifacts at material boundaries and handling special cases like bone visualization.
